Quarter Analysis1
Income attributable to Shell plc shareholders, compared with the fourth quarter 2024, reflected lower exploration
well write-offs, lower operating expenses and higher Products margins. First quarter 2025 income attributable to Shell plc shareholders also included a charge of $0.5 billion related to the UK
Energy Profits Levy and impairment charges. These items are included in identified items amounting to a net loss of
$0.8 billion in the quarter. This compares with identified items in the fourth quarter 2024 which amounted to a net loss of
$2.8 billion. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA2 were driven by the same factors as income attributable to Shell plc
shareholders and adjusted for the above identified items. Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter 2025 was $9.3 billion and primarily driven by Adjusted
EBITDA, partly offset by tax payments of $2.9 billion and working capital outflows of $2.7 billion. The working capital
outflows mainly reflected accounts receivable and payable movements. Cash flow from investing activities for the first quarter 2025 was an outflow of $4.0 billion, and included cash capital
expenditure of $4.2 billion, and net other investing cash outflows of $0.9 billion which included the drawdowns on loan
facilities provided at completion of the sale of The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) in
Nigeria, partly offset by divestment proceeds of $0.6 billion. Net debt and Gearing: At the end of the first quarter 2025, net debt was $41.5 billion, compared with $38.8 billion at
the end of the fourth quarter 2024. This reflects free cash flow of $5.3 billion, which included working capital outflows of
$2.7 billion, more than offset by share buybacks of $3.3 billion, cash dividends paid to Shell plc shareholders of $2.2
billion, lease additions of $1.3 billion including those related to the Pavilion Energy Pte. Ltd. acquisition and interest
payments of $0.8 billion. Gearing was 18.7% at the end of the first quarter 2025, compared with 17.7% at the end of the
fourth quarter 2024, mainly driven by higher net debt.

In March 2025, we completed the previously announced acquisition of 100% of the shares in Pavilion Energy Pte. Ltd.
(Pavilion Energy). Pavilion Energy, headquartered in Singapore, operates a global LNG trading business with contracted
supply volume of approximately 6.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). Upstream
In January 2025, we announced the start of production at the Shell-operated Whale floating production facility in the Gulf
of America. The Whale development is owned by Shell (60%, operator) and Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (40%). In February 2025, we announced production restart at the Penguins field in the UK North Sea with a modern floating,
production, storage and offloading (FPSO) facility (Shell 50%, operator; NEO Energy 50%). The previous export route for
this field was via the Brent Charlie platform, which ceased production in 2021 and is being decommissioned. In February 2025, we signed an agreement to acquire a 15.96% working interest from ConocoPhillips Company in the
Shell-operated Ursa platform in the Gulf of America. The transaction completed on May 1, 2025 which increases Shell's
working interest in the Ursa platform from 45.3884% to 61.3484%. In March 2025, we completed the sale of SPDC to Renaissance, as announced in January 2024. In March 2025, we announced the Final Investment Decision (FID) for Gato do Mato, a deep-water project in the pre-salt
area of the Santos Basin, offshore Brazil. The Gato do Mato Consortium includes Shell (operator, 50%), Ecopetrol (30%),
TotalEnergies (20%) and Pré-Sal Petróleo S.A. (PPSA) acting as the manager of the production sharing contract (PSC). Chemicals and Products

Integrated Gas includes liquefied natural gas (LNG), conversion of natural gas into gas-to-liquids (GTL) fuels and other
products. It includes natural gas and liquids exploration and extraction, and the operation of the upstream and midstream
infrastructure necessary to deliver these to market. Integrated Gas also includes the marketing, trading and optimisation of
LNG. Quarter Analysis1
Income/(loss) for the period was driven by the same factors as Adjusted Earnings and includes identified items. Adjusted Earnings, compared with the fourth quarter 2024, reflected lower exploration well write-offs ($277 million),
partly offset by lower LNG liquefaction volumes (decrease of $68 million). The net effect of contributions from trading and
optimisation and realised prices was in line with the fourth quarter 2024 despite higher unfavourable (non-cash) impact of
expiring hedging contracts. Identified items in the first quarter 2025 included favourable movements of $362 million due to the fair value accounting
of commodity derivatives, that as part of Shell's normal business are entered into as hedges for mitigation of economic
exposures on future purchases, sales and inventory. These favourable movements compare with the fourth quarter 2024
which included impairment charges of $339 million and a loss of $96 million related to sale of assets, partly offset by
favourable movements of $109 million due to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives. Adjusted EBITDA2 was driven by the same factors as Adjusted Earnings. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was primarily driven by Adjusted EBITDA, and net cash inflows
related to derivatives of $542 million, partly offset by tax payments of $773 million and working capital outflows of $687
million. Total oil and gas production, compared with the fourth quarter 2024, increased by 2% mainly due to lower planned
maintenance in Pearl GTL (Qatar), partly offset by unplanned maintenance and weather constraints in Australia. LNG
liquefaction volumes decreased by 6% mainly due to unplanned maintenance and weather constraints in Australia.

The Upstream segment includes exploration and extraction of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also markets
and transports oil and gas, and operates the infrastructure necessary to deliver them to the market. Quarter Analysis1
Income/(loss) for the period was driven by the same factors as Adjusted Earnings and includes identified items. Adjusted Earnings, compared with the fourth quarter 2024, reflected lower exploration well write-offs ($346 million),
lower depreciation, depletion and amortisation expenses (decrease of $330 million), lower operating expenses ($194
million) and comparative favourable tax movements ($179 million), partly offset by lower volumes (decrease of $359
million). Identified items in the first quarter 2025 included a charge of $509 million related to the UK Energy Profits Levy, partly
offset by gains of $159 million from disposal of assets and gains of $95 million related to the impact of the strengthening
Brazilian real on a deferred tax position. These charges and favourable movements compare with the fourth quarter 2024
which included a loss of $161 million related to the impact of the weakening Brazilian real on a deferred tax position, and
impairment charges of $152 million. Adjusted EBITDA2 was driven by the same factors as Adjusted Earnings. Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter 2025 was primarily driven by Adjusted EBITDA, partly offset
by tax payments of $1,999 million and working capital outflows of $913 million. Total production, compared with the fourth quarter 2024, decreased mainly due to the SPDC divestment, largely offset
by new oil production.

The Marketing segment comprises the Mobility, Lubricants, and Sectors and Decarbonisation businesses. The Mobility
business operates Shell’s retail network including electric vehicle charging services and the Wholesale commercial fuels
business which provides fuels for transport, industry and heating. The Lubricants business produces, markets and sells
lubricants for road transport, and machinery used in manufacturing, mining, power generation, agriculture and
construction. The Sectors and Decarbonisation business sells fuels, speciality products and services including low-carbon
energy solutions to a broad range of commercial customers including the aviation, marine, and agricultural sectors. Quarter Analysis1
Income/(loss) for the period was driven by the same factors as Adjusted Earnings and includes identified items. Adjusted Earnings, compared with the fourth quarter 2024, reflected lower operating expenses (decrease of $69
million), and higher Marketing margins (increase of $54 million) mainly due to higher Lubricants unit margins and seasonal
impact of higher volumes partly offset by lower Mobility margins due to seasonal impact of lower volumes and lower
Sectors and Decarbonisation margins. These net gains were partly offset by unfavourable tax movements ($109 million). Identified items in the first quarter 2025 included net losses of $61 million related to sale of assets. These losses compare
with the fourth quarter 2024 which included impairment charges of $458 million, and net losses of $247 million related to
sale of assets. Adjusted EBITDA2 was driven by the same factors as Adjusted Earnings. Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter 2025 was primarily driven by Adjusted EBITDA, inflows
relating to the timing impact of payments related to emission certificates and biofuel programmes of $540 million, and
dividends (net of profits) from joint ventures and associates of $203 million. These inflows were partly offset by working
capital outflows of $344 million and tax payments of $174 million. Marketing sales volumes (comprising hydrocarbon sales), compared with the fourth quarter 2024, decreased mainly
due to seasonality.

The Chemicals and Products segment includes chemicals manufacturing plants with their own marketing network, and
refineries which turn crude oil and other feedstocks into a range of oil products which are moved and marketed around the
world for domestic, industrial and transport use. The segment also includes the pipeline business, trading and optimisation
of crude oil, oil products and petrochemicals, and Oil Sands activities (the extraction of bitumen from mined oil sands and
its conversion into synthetic crude oil). Quarter Analysis1
Income/(loss) for the period was driven by the same factors as Adjusted Earnings and includes identified items. Adjusted Earnings, compared with the fourth quarter 2024, reflected higher Products margins (increase of $546 million)
mainly driven by higher margins from trading and optimisation and higher refining margins. Adjusted Earnings also
reflected higher Chemicals margins (increase of $115 million). In addition, the first quarter 2025 reflected lower operating
expenses (decrease of $134 million). These net gains were partly offset by comparative unfavourable tax movements ($96
million). In the first quarter 2025, Chemicals had negative Adjusted Earnings of $137 million and Products had positive Adjusted
Earnings of $586 million. Identified items in the first quarter 2025 included impairment charges of $277 million, and unfavourable movements of
$202 million due to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives, that as part of Shell's normal business are entered
into as hedges for mitigation of economic exposures on future purchases, sales and inventory. These charges and
unfavourable movements compare with the fourth quarter 2024 which included impairment charges of $224 million,
partly offset by favourable deferred tax movements of $114 million.. Adjusted EBITDA2 was driven by the same factors as Adjusted Earnings. Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter 2025 was primarily driven by Adjusted EBITDA, and inflows
relating to the timing impact of payments relating to emission certificates and biofuel programmes of $125 million. These
inflows were partly offset by working capital outflows of $1,081 million, and net cash outflows relating to commodity
derivatives of $508 million. Chemicals manufacturing plant utilisation was 81% compared with 75% in the fourth quarter 2024, mainly due to
lower planned and unplanned maintenance. Refinery utilisation was 85% compared with 76% in the fourth quarter 2024, mainly due to lower planned
maintenance.

3.Physical natural gas sales to third parties; excluding financial trades and physical trade with brokers, investors, financial institutions, trading platforms, and

optimisation of power and pipeline gas, as well as carbon credits, and digitally enabled customer solutions. It also
includes the production and marketing of hydrogen, development of commercial carbon capture and storage hubs,
investment in nature-based projects that avoid or reduce carbon emissions, and Shell Ventures, which invests in companies
that work to accelerate the energy and mobility transformation. Quarter Analysis1
Income/(loss) for the period was driven by the same factors as Adjusted Earnings and includes identified items. Adjusted Earnings, compared with the fourth quarter 2024, reflected higher margins (increase of $99 million) mainly
due to higher trading and optimisation in the Americas as a result of higher seasonal demand and volatility, lower
operating expenses (decrease of $90 million) and comparative favourable tax movements ($89 million). Most
Renewables and Energy Solutions activities were loss-making in the first quarter 2025, which was partly offset by positive
Adjusted Earnings from trading and optimisation. Identified items in the first quarter 2025 included a charge of $143 million related to the disposal of assets. These
charges compare with the fourth quarter 2024 which included impairment charges of $996 million mainly relating to
renewable generation assets in North America, partly offset by favourable movements of $50 million due to the fair value
accounting of commodity derivatives, that as part of Shell's normal business are entered into as hedges for mitigation of
economic exposures on future purchases, sales and inventory. Adjusted EBITDA2 was driven by the same factors as Adjusted Earnings. Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter 2025 was primarily driven by net cash inflows relating to
working capital of $380 million and Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by outflows related to derivatives of $169 million.

Income/(loss) for the period was driven by the same factors as Adjusted Earnings and includes identified items. Adjusted Earnings, compared with the fourth quarter 2024, reflected unfavourable currency exchange rate effects,
partly offset by lower operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA2 was driven by the same factors as Adjusted Earnings.

1st QUARTER 2025 UNAUDITED RESULTS

## OUTLOOK FOR THE SECOND QUARTER 2025

Full year 2024 cash capital expenditure was $21 billion. Our cash capital expenditure range for the full year 2025 is
expected to be within $20 - $22 billion. Integrated Gas production is expected to be approximately 890 - 950 thousand boe/d. LNG liquefaction
volumes are expected to be approximately 6.3 - 6.9 million tonnes. Second quarter 2025 outlook reflects
scheduled maintenance across the portfolio. Upstream production is expected to be approximately 1,560 - 1,760 thousand boe/d. Production outlook reflects the
SPDC divestment in March 2025 and the scheduled maintenance across the portfolio. Marketing sales volumes are expected to be approximately 2,600 - 3,100 thousand b/d. Refinery utilisation is expected to be approximately 87% - 95%. Chemicals manufacturing plant utilisation is expected to
be approximately 74% - 82%. Second quarter 2025 utilisation outlook reflects the sale of the Energy and Chemicals Park
in Singapore which was completed in April 2025. Corporate Adjusted Earnings1 were a net expense of $457 million for the first quarter 2025. Corporate Adjusted Earnings
are expected to be a net expense of approximately $400 - $600 million in the second quarter 2025.

## SHELL PLC

1st QUARTER 2025 UNAUDITED RESULTS

## NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


## 1. Basis of preparation

These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements of Shell plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries
(collectively referred to as “Shell”) have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued
by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and adopted by the UK, and on the basis of the same
accounting principles as those used in the Company's Annual Report and Accounts (pages 240 to 312) for the year ended
December 31, 2024, as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales and as filed with the Autoriteit
Financiële Markten (the Netherlands) and Form 20-F (pages 223 to 296) for the year ended December 31, 2024, as filed
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with these filings. The financial information presented in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements does not
constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434(3) of the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”). Statutory
accounts for the year ended December 31, 2024, were published in Shell's Annual Report and Accounts, a copy of which
was delivered to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales. The auditor's report on those accounts was
unqualified, did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without
qualifying the report and did not contain a statement under sections 498(2) or 498(3) of the Act. Key accounting considerations, significant judgements and estimates
Future commodity price assumptions and management's view on the future development of refining and chemicals margins
represent a significant estimate and were subject to change in 2024. These assumptions continue to apply for impairment
testing purposes in the first quarter 2025. As per the normal process outlined in the 2024 Annual Report and Accounts
and Form 20-F, these assumptions are subject to review later this year. The discount rates applied for impairment testing and the discount rate applied to provisions are reviewed on a regular
basis. Both discount rates applied in the first quarter 2025 remain unchanged compared with 2024.

## 2. Segment information

With effect from January 1, 2025, segment earnings are presented on an Adjusted Earnings basis (Adjusted Earnings),
which is the earnings measure used by the Chief Executive Officer, who serves as the Chief Operating Decision Maker, for
the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. This aligns with Shell's focus on
performance, discipline and simplification. The Adjusted Earnings measure is presented on a current cost of supplies (CCS) basis and aims to facilitate a comparative
understanding of Shell's financial performance from period to period by removing the effects of oil price changes on
inventory carrying amounts and removing the effects of identified items. Identified items are in some cases driven by
external factors and may, either individually or collectively, hinder the comparative understanding of Shell's financial
results from period to period. The segment earnings measure used until December 31, 2024 was CCS earnings. The difference between CCS earnings
and Adjusted Earnings are the identified items. Comparative periods are presented below on an Adjusted Earnings basis. Page 14

generally uncontrollable and unusual (infrequent or non-recurring) in nature or giving rise to a mismatch between
accounting and economic results, or certain transactions that are generally excluded from underlying results in the
industry. Identified items comprise: divestment gains and losses, impairments and impairment reversals, redundancy and
restructuring, fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and certain gas contracts that gives rise to a mismatch
between accounting and economic results, the impact of exchange rate movements and inflationary adjustments on
certain deferred tax balances, and other items. Q1 2025 $ million

1. Fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and certain gas contracts: In the ordinary course of business, Shell enters into contracts to supply or purchase
oil and gas products, as well as power and environmental products. Shell also enters into contracts for tolling, pipeline and storage capacity. Derivative
contracts are entered into for mitigation of resulting economic exposures (generally price exposure) and these derivative contracts are carried at period-end

market price (fair value), with movements in fair value recognised in income for the period. Supply and purchase contracts entered into for operational
purposes, as well as contracts for tolling, pipeline and storage capacity, are, by contrast, recognised when the transaction occurs; furthermore, inventory is
carried at historical cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. As a consequence, accounting mismatches occur because: (a) the supply or purchase
transaction is recognised in a different period; or (b) the inventory is measured on a different basis. In addition, certain contracts are, due to pricing or delivery
conditions, deemed to contain embedded derivatives or written options and are also required to be carried at fair value even though they are entered into for
operational purposes. The accounting impacts are reported as identified items.
2. Other identified items represent other credits or charges that based on Shell management's assessment hinder the comparative understanding of Shell's
financial results from period to period.
3. Impact of exchange rate movements and inflationary adjustments on tax balances represents the impact on tax balances of exchange rate movements and
inflationary adjustments arising on: (a) the conversion to dollars of the local currency tax base of non-monetary assets and liabilities, as well as recognised tax
losses (this primarily impacts the Integrated Gas and Upstream segments); and (b) the conversion of dollar-denominated inter-segment loans to local currency,
leading to taxable exchange rate gains or losses (this primarily impacts the Corporate segment). Q4 2024 $ million

The merger reserve and share premium reserve were established as a consequence of Shell plc (formerly Royal Dutch Shell
plc) becoming the single parent company of Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and The “Shell” Transport and Trading
Company, p.l.c., now The Shell Transport and Trading Company Limited, in 2005. The merger reserve increased in 2016
following the issuance of shares for the acquisition of BG Group plc. The capital redemption reserve was established in
connection with repurchases of shares of Shell plc. The share plan reserve is in respect of equity-settled share-based
compensation plans.

## 6. Derivative financial instruments and debt excluding lease liabilities

As disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, presented in the Annual
Report and Accounts and Form 20-F for that year, Shell is exposed to the risks of changes in fair value of its financial assets
and liabilities. The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values at March 31, 2025, are consistent with those used in the year
ended December 31, 2024, though the carrying amounts of derivative financial instruments have changed since that date. Page 20

## SHELL PLC

1st QUARTER 2025 UNAUDITED RESULTS

## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE (NON-GAAP) MEASURES

A. Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation
(“Adjusted EBITDA”) and Cash flow from operating activities
The “Adjusted Earnings” measure aims to facilitate a comparative understanding of Shell’s financial performance from
period to period by removing the effects of oil price changes on inventory carrying amounts and removing the effects of
identified items. These items are in some cases driven by external factors and may, either individually or collectively, hinder
the comparative understanding of Shell’s financial results from period to period. This measure excludes earnings
attributable to non-controlling interest when presenting the total Shell Group result but includes these items when
presenting individual segment Adjusted Earnings as set out in the table below. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as “Income/(loss) for the period” adjusted for current cost of supplies; identified items; tax
charge/(credit); depreciation, amortisation and depletion; exploration well write-offs and net interest expense. All items
include the non-controlling interest component. Management uses this measure to evaluate Shell's performance in the
period and over time. Q1 2025 $ million

Identified items
The objective of identified items is to remove material impacts on net income/loss arising from transactions which are
generally uncontrollable and unusual (infrequent or non-recurring) in nature or giving rise to a mismatch between
accounting and economic results, or certain transactions that are generally excluded from underlying results in the
industry. Page 25

Identified items comprise: divestment gains and losses, impairments and impairment reversals, redundancy and
restructuring, fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and certain gas contracts that gives rise to a mismatch
between accounting and economic results, the impact of exchange rate movements and inflationary adjustments on
certain deferred tax balances, and other items. See Note 2 “Segment information” for details. B. Adjusted Earnings per share
Adjusted Earnings per share is calculated as Adjusted Earnings (see Reference A), divided by the weighted average
number of shares used as the basis for basic earnings per share (see Note 3). C. Cash capital expenditure
Cash capital expenditure represents cash spent on maintaining and developing assets as well as on investments in the
period. Management regularly monitors this measure as a key lever to delivering sustainable cash flows. Cash capital
expenditure is the sum of the following lines from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Capital expenditure,
Investments in joint ventures and associates and Investments in equity securities. See Note 2 “Segment information” for the reconciliation of cash capital expenditure. D. Capital employed and Return on average capital employed
Return on average capital employed ("ROACE") measures the efficiency of Shell’s utilisation of the capital that it employs. The measure refers to Capital employed which consists of total equity, current debt, and non-current debt reduced by cash
and cash equivalents. In this calculation, the sum of Adjusted Earnings (see Reference A) plus non-controlling interest (NCI) excluding identified
items for the current and previous three quarters, adjusted for after-tax interest expense and after-tax interest income, is
expressed as a percentage of the average capital employed excluding cash and cash equivalents for the same period.

E. Net debt and gearing
Net debt is defined as the sum of current and non-current debt, less cash and cash equivalents, adjusted for the fair value
of derivative financial instruments used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk relating to debt, and associated
collateral balances. Management considers this adjustment useful because it reduces the volatility of net debt caused by
fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates, and eliminates the potential impact of related collateral payments or
receipts. Debt-related derivative financial instruments are a subset of the derivative financial instrument assets and
liabilities presented on the balance sheet. Collateral balances are reported under “Trade and other receivables” or “Trade
and other payables” as appropriate. Gearing is a measure of Shell's capital structure and is defined as net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) as a
percentage of total capital (net debt plus total equity).

G. Free cash flow and Organic free cash flow
Free cash flow is used to evaluate cash available for financing activities, including dividend payments and debt servicing,
after investment in maintaining and growing the business. It is defined as the sum of “Cash flow from operating activities”
and “Cash flow from investing activities”. Cash flows from acquisition and divestment activities are removed from Free cash flow to arrive at the Organic free cash
flow, a measure used by management to evaluate the generation of free cash flow without these activities. Page 28
